⁸ Otium. Odium, which seems the most probable read-

ilrpg, is found in many MSS. though not preferred by the

wt Apud te gloriari. The present, and every opportunity,
in taken by Cicero, of paying to his* own conduct during
his consulate, most extravagant eompliments, apparently
very little merited. When a magistrate takes on himself
to enecate his follow-citizens, rrrrheard and without trial,
hc needs some better justification than aelf-gratulation, 01
the applauses of those of his own party. It is difficult to
assign any justificarion for putting 1ο death the inferior
agents in 0 conspiracy, 01 0 moment when they were
peculiarly under‘ the protection of the laws, and when
nothing could be feared from them personally; whilsta
formidable party 01 the same moment was suffered 10
collect in arms, to enlist men, it would seem, without op
positi0n; and their leader, even encouraged to join them.
After the rebellion was quelled, no peine seem to have been
tehen by the senate, either 1ο remove the causes 01 the
publio discontents, or 10 reform their constitution, ill adapt
ed, or rather totally unfit, for the eircmnstances in which
multiplied conquesta had placed them. Another rebellion,
still more formidable, epeedily arose, in which their repuli
lic, 00 might have been expected, was completely over·
whelmed. Had the party prevailed, of which Pompcy was
the leader, the event would not have been different.
