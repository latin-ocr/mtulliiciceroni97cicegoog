10 DE ormella.

Perfectum officium* rectum, opinor, vocemus,
quod Graeci κατόρθωμα, hoc antem commune† offi-
cium vocant. Atque ea sic definiunt, ut rectum
quod sit, id perfectum officium esse definiant;
medium autem officium id esse dicant, quod cur
factum sit, ratio probabilis reddi possit.‡

Triplex igiturest, ut Panaetio videtur, con·
silli capiundi deliberatio. Nam honestumne factu
sit, an turpe, dubitant, id, quod in deliberationem
cadit: inquo considerando aaepe animi in con·
tracias sententias distrahuntur. Tum autem aut

quoniamque iu iia robus quae neque in virtutibus aunt ne·
que in vitiis, eat tamen quiddam quod usui poeniteres, tol·
lendum id non cst.” ’

⁰ Perfectum officium. This sentence is suspected by
Facclolati to be 00 interpolation founded ou a gloss
brought into the text from the margin. At least lt ia pa·
rcutbetical. After the word commune, Maturantius, an
early editor, introduced the word ltaliam, which ia re·
tained ln many modern editions, although not known to
be warranted by a single ΜΒ. The Stolos did not in fact
distribute our ‹lutles into Κατορθῶμιτιι and retina: on
the contrary the 11011011 was the genus divided into 1110
species, the Karlglayaa and liadizos nicar, corresponding
with Cicero's osticium rectum, und officium commune.

lHoc cutem. commune. ln this instance hcc refers 10
that which is most remote, medium officium ,· and ir used

1 Reddi poerit. Maturantina adduces as instaures of tlte
officium medium ; when Timophanes of Corinth attempted
to make himself despotical master 01 hia native city, hit
brother Timoleon, instead of giving him aid, put him 10
deatla. 10 this case the ratio probabilia was the duty
which Timoleon owed to hia country. Agnis, one friend
requires repayment from another of a aum borrowed:
this is refused, aa lhe borrower known that it would be
¹¹naployed in a mode injurioua 10 their common country.
