term privatos does not here mesra one opime citizens in
general, but a person distinguished by some circmnstanoe

om mem, on the one hand, on the other, from him, “qui
gerit personam civitatis.'‘ Adverting to the rules of go-
vemn'rent 'in the populor states of antiquity, and in Rome
in particular, petrolus may be conjectured in this passage
to mean a person tolo ltus horne, bert t's no longer in office5
ort emmegistrate. Among the interpretatione of the word
given by Fnccioloti, it is said: “Privatus homo dioitrtr qni
m magistratu non θεῖς ἰδιώτης. Nsm‘qu‘i magistratum
gerit est publieus.” But it is apprehendctl thuin this

which induces Cicero to worn the ex-timctionary against
horbouring ambitione designs, and egoinstarro enee. This
interpretation is however submitted with much diffidence,
osithae not the support of any passage where the word
bears exactlp the some import, nor has it been suggested
by any previous commentator.
